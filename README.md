# Student Grade Predictor

## What the Project Does
This Python application predicts student grades using a Linear Regression Machine Learning model. It takes input data such as semester grades, study time, number of failures, and absences, and provides a prediction for the final grade based on this information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (install using the command below)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-grade-predictor.git

   cd student-grade-predictor
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
4. Choose between two moodes:
   - **Analysis Mode:** (currently to be implemented)
   - **Grade Prediction Mode:** Input the required details such as semester grades, study time, number of failures, and absences. The application will return a predicted final grade.
